# Fitted

## Description
The web app will allow users to store clothes from their wardrobe and then recommend outfit for the day.

## More Details
The ideal users are people in all age ranges that struggle with picking an outfit for the day. Maybe 15-25yr olds.  

**User roles -** just a regular user that has their own wardrobe and suggestions based on that  

**Approach -**  
A user will be able to click pictures of their clothes and add them to their wardrobe.  
Once they add a few pieces, our ML model will kick in and start recommending pieces that go together.  
They can also then choose to favorite outfits so our recommendation model learns and suggests similar outfit  

**Goal -** Help users save that extra precious time in the morning (when they are already late to school/work) by not having to spend 10-15 mins on just deciding what to wear
